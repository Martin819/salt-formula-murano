Murano
======

Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready applications in a browsableâ€Ž categorised catalog, which may be used by the cloud users (including the inexperienced ones) to pick-up the needed applications and services and composes the reliable environments out of them in a "push-the-button" manner.
